jsx=>
  file format that allow to write both html and javascript code

  javaScript codes must be inlcued inside the {} bracket. specially inside return, when writing or passing javascript variabe , props >must use {}
  
return =>
  include the DOM (the HTML codes) and only the Codes inside return is shown in the web.  reutrn can return only one parent element(like only one div and all emlements inside of the div, to solve this we have empty fragment)

<> </>  =>
  it's a empty fragment that solve the return problem. using this now we can use HTML as we want
