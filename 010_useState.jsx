const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
//so=>
useState => hook(useState hook) //that creates a state
count =>state variable
setCount => function.

//here 
Think of useState(0) as creating a box (state) with a default value (0).

    count is whatâ€™s inside the box.(the content inside the state)
    setCount is the tool to modify the contents of the box.(a function to update the content)
